# Quote App

## TO RUN:
./gradlew run --> quote is displayed in terminal!

## Overview
This app uses Gson to parse a Json file and display a random quote
to the terminal each time the app is run. 

#### Tests
We wrote a test to verify the constructor in the Quotes Class

### Day (Lab 9)
Added API functionality that displays a random star wars quote to the terminal. 
If the API fails it pulls a random quote from offline file quotes.json.
